#  Vehicle Sales Database - SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a **Vehicle Sales Database** using PostgreSQL, designed to store and analyze vehicle sales data, dealership performance, and customer transactions. The database consists of multiple interconnected tables that enable efficient querying and reporting.

The SQL scripts in this repository include database schema creation, sample data population, and advanced queries for insights such as top dealerships by revenue, frequently serviced vehicles, and customer purchase history.
